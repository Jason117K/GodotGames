# PVZ
 - Eye of Sin is a 2D PVZ-like tower defense game set in an Earth ruined due to the hubris of Man, who thought they could control Eldritch forces. The player takes the role of a sorcerer traveling in search of a way to reclaim Earth and rid it of the horrors that permeate the surface. Biomes will be based off of Earth locations, but with a dark corrupted fantasy twist. Enemies will be zombies with a variety of mutations, and towers will be Eldritch summons (giant eyes, giant spiders, eye-plant/eye-animal fusions, etc.)
